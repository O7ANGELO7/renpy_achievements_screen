# Renpy Achievements Screen

Have you ever wanted a clean and flexible way of handling achievements inside your RenPy game?

Easy! I have made things a lot easier for those looking to add achievements to their RenPy games with a lot less hassle. The source code contains comments describing each element so you won't get confused or lost. But if in case you do I am happy to assist.

NOTE: I should clarify that this project is solely intended to simply display achievements on a screen and a simple notification. If you want to go deeper you are free to add/amend/remove parts of the code to fit your needs. There is very little code that uses the built-in RenPy achievement system. The code hasn't been built around Steam achievements either, but you are welcome to implement that yourself.
